**Objective:** Use natural language processing and sentiment analysis to research the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the review of Yankee Candle products on Amazon.

**Hypothesis:** That average review ratings and sentiment for Yankee Candle products on Amazon have decreased in 2020, when compared to previous years, due to the common coronavirus sympton of a loss of smell. My assertion is that purchasers of Yankee Candles blame the manufacturer for a lack of scent in the product, without realizing it is their own health condition that is at fault.
